# # Simple Interest Calculator 
 
# Introduction: 
An interest calculator or loan calculator is a Python GUI based mini project. A simple interest calculator is a utility tool that calculates the interest on loans or savings without compounding. You may calculate the simple interest on the principal amount on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis. The simple interest calculator has a formula box, where you enter the principal amount, annual rate, and period in days, months, or years. The calculator will display interest on the loan or the investment.
